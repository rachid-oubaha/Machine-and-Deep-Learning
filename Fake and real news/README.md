## Fake and real news
### Project description:
In this project, We built a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.Using RNN network.

### Prerequisites:
- Python
- Nltk
- Re
- Gensim
- Wordcloud  
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn 
- keras

### Steps for detecting fake news with Python:
- Import the necessary libraries (Nltk, Gensim , ...).
- Read the data into a DataFrame, and get the info of the data and the first 5 records.
- Do some exploratory data analysis to get a better sense of the data we have.
- visualize the text data using Wordcloud
- Apply some preprocessing text functions: removing not useful chacarters and removing the unnecessary  words ...
- Apply tokenization to convert texts to sequences of numbers.
- capture the context of words by using Word embedding technique
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train and evaluate the model

You will find more detail information in notebook,it is clearly explained.
