## Employees Turnover
### Project description:

In this project, we’ll build  models that will predict the probability of an employee leaving a company. Retaining the best employees is an important factor for most organizations. To build our models, we’ll use this [dataset available at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv#HR_comma_sep.csv), which has features that measure employee satisfaction in a company.

### Prerequisites:
- Python
- Google colab
