## Employees Turnover
### Project description:

In this project, we’ll build  models that will predict the probability of an employee leaving a company. Retaining the best employees is an important factor for most organizations. To build this project, we’ll use this [dataset available at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv#HR_comma_sep.csv), which has features that measure employee satisfaction in a company.

## Customers Churn
### Project description:

Banking is one of the highly competitive sectors where customer relations is of utmost importance for any bank. Each customer is considered as a customer for life by the banks. The term “Customer Churn” refers to the state in which the customer or the subscriber stops involving in business transactions with a company or a service provider. To deal with this, the project presents the work done towards predicting the customer churn rate, using machine learning models which will indicate whether a customer will leave the bank or not based on many factors, this in turn will help the bank in knowing which category of customers generally tend to leave the bank. Further the banks can bring in exciting offers so that it can retain its customers. To build this project, we’ll use this[dataset available at GitHub](https://github.com/sharmaroshan/Churn-Modelling-Dataset/blob/master/Churn_Modelling.csv).

Predict bank customer churn based on 13 features, including row number, customer id, surname, credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products purchased through the bank, whether has a credit card, whether is an active member, estimated salary.



### Prerequisites:
To create these models, we’ll need the following:
- Python
- Google colab
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Logistic regression
- SVC - Support Vector Classifier
