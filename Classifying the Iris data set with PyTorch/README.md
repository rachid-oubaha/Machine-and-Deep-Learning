## Classifying the Iris data set with PyTorch
### What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language.

pytorch includes 2 packages:
The torch package that has the core of deep learning functions.
The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision



### Features

An n-dimensional Tensor, similar to numpy but can run on GPUs.
PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs.


### Advantages of pytorch

it provides maximum flexibility.
It is easy to learn and simpler to code.
it is easy to debug.
It includes a lot of loss functions.
It allows building networks whose structure is dependent on computation itself.

### PyTorch installation

To install PyTorch we use :
```
pip install torch torchvision
pip install torch torchvision --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

### PyTorch and TensorFlow

> #### TensorFlow

Simple built-in high-level API.
Visualizing training with Tensorboard.
Production-ready thanks to TensorFlow serving.
Easy mobile support.
Open source.
Good documentation and community support.

> #### PyTorch

Python-like coding.
Visualizing training with Visdom.
Dynamic graph.
Easy & quick editing.
Good documentation and community support.
Open source.


### Application of PyTorch

Computer Vision.
Natural Language Processing.
Reinforcement Learning.


### Gradient descent
**backward()** : The **backward()** method in Pytorch is used to calculate **the gradient** during the backward pass in the neural network.


### Example
